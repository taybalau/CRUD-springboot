# API REST - CRUD with SpringBoot and MongoDB
   This project uses Spring Boot and the non-relational MongoDB database to create a CRUD that returns information about financial fraud.
   
   For this, I used a synthetic financial datasets for fraud detection. If you want it, you can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ealaxi/paysim1).

# How to use it?
  First of all, you need to create a connection in mongodb on port 27017. After that, you must make a database called mongodb-crud and import [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LxoIgjLxpGir0Yp-MK98meK2Uliuaz3t/view?usp=sharing) collection into it

  Once that's done, it's interesting to import [this json](https://github.com/taybalau/CRUD-springboot/blob/master/FraudDetection-CRUD.postman_collection.json) into your postman. It contains all the endpoints of the application for local tests.

  After these two steps, as we say in Brazil: the ice cream is ready.
